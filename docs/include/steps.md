First install the [Steps package](https://github.com/portphp/steps):

```bash
$ composer require portphp/steps:1.0.x-dev portphp/portphp:1.0.x-dev
```

And include Composer’s autoloader in your project:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

For integration with Symfony projects, a 
[PortSymfonyBundle](https://github.com/portphp/symfony-bundle) is available.
